		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern
				Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in
				the environment it creates.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>But heres the catch: Dll injection isnt just used by game cheats. They are also used by
					<em><em>malware</em></em>.
					Due to this antivirus try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors they detect without actually
					knowing what if they are safe or not.
					You will usually see antivirus calling most exploits including krnl a Cryptinject.msr trojan because
					of this.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>"But then how can you prove Krnl isn't malware?" you might ask.
					User trust and safety is priority at Krnl, due to this the only hidden/protected part of the Krnl
					client is the dll that is injected into Roblox(This being krnl.dll).
					Other than the dll Krnl client is completely unobfuscated/unprotected.
					Both the Krnl bootstrapper <em><strong>and</strong></em> krnl itself's code is completely readable
					using a .NET decompiler like dnSpy or DotPeek (or even just a text editor like notepad for the node
					js bootstrapper).
					This means that you <em>yes</em> <em><strong>you</strong></em> can look at the code that runs the
					Krnl client.
					Here are the links to both the bootstrapper and the main executable files source code.</p>

						Executable Source</a> -- krnlss.exe</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please keep in mind that this isnt the exact source code as the Asyncronous Functions wont be fully
			decompiled in dnSpy. However it should still give you a good idea of if Krnl is safe or not.</p>

			PARTY ANTIVIRUS
		</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>To fix this issue you must uninstall any 3rd party antivirus from your system.
				Such as McAfee, Norton, Eset, Kaspersky etc.
				Sorry but there isnt another way of solving this issue. From my and many users experiences
				excluding/disabling 3rd party antivirus is
				terrible and doesnt yield consistent/reliable results.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Once that you have uninstalled your 3rd party antivirus and rebooted your pc (Or you didnt have any to begin
			with).
			Its time to exclude Krnl from Windows Defender which is the default antivirus that comes with Windows 10.
			To do this we recommend watching a tutorial from YouTube.
			But in short all you need to do is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to the virus and threat protection settings in Windows 10.</li>

		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This error is caused by the included injector that comes with krnlss.exe being not very good.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To solve this issue you need to use a 3rd party injector such as Extreme Injector
			or the built-in dll injection functionality of other software such as Process Hacker.</p>
		<p>We recommend watching a YouTube tutorial on how to do this. Heres a link to one made by me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QzXe2Jr_y0" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> But here's a quick
			rundown of the basic steps involved.</p>
		<p>After injecting all you need to do is getting a key.
			How to do this can be found in step 3.
			After you enter your key in it and press enter.
			It should automatically close the console window
			and the "Inject" button in the Krnl UI should turn into "Injected"</p>

			about how to get a key in the first place and how they work.
		</h3>
		<p>Krnl Keys are based on your IP. This means that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>You cannot share your keys with others</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If you decide to use a VPN when using Krnl it has to be a desktop VPN and not a browser extension
					VPN.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Your key will be invalidated if your ip changes
					(meaning if you turn your pc off for an extended period of time or reboot your router your key will
					get invalidated)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To get a key you must go to the URL that is given to you in the console popup window after you inject krnl.
		</p>
		<p>This URL being: <a href="https://cdn.krnl.gg/getkey.php" rel="nofollow">https://cdn.krnl.gg/getkey.php</a>
		</p>
		<p>After you go to it for the first time you should be redirected to a linkvertise link.
			If you get prompted to do a survey just click on the x.
			Then click on free access with ads.
			Do the tasks and move onto the next link.
			Now do this 4 more times.
			And you will finally be directed to the keypage where you can copy your key and
			paste it into the console window from before then press enter.</p>
		<p>It should check your key for a few seconds then the console window should disappear and krnl should be
			injected.</p>
